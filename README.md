# Edustor Core

Edustor is a cloud service that stores scans of handwritten papers.

This is Core microservice which is primarily responsible for storing metadata.

## How does it work?

* Get blank Edustor Pages and print them. Make sure you don't print single page twice, all of them are unique.
* Write, draw, do whatever you usually do with paper. Just keep QR-code at the right bottom corner safe.
* Link used pages to a lesson by scanning QR-code with [Edustor Android app](https://github.com/edustor/android)
* Scan them to PDF and upload to Edustor
* Now you can access these scans in the app (and share them as PDF)

## Cool! I wanna try it!

Right now Edustor is still on early-alpha stage, so there is no public beta available. But we are interested in
alpha testers anyway, so feel free to contact us.

## Can I use Edustor source code

Yes, you can, but only for non-profit purposes. Please refer [Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/NPOSL-3.0)
