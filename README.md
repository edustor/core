# Edustor

Edustor is a cloud service for storing scanned notes.

## How am I supposed to use ths?

* Download specially generated pdf with unique pages from [here](https://edustor.ru/pdf), print it and write whatever 
  you want on these pages. 
* Get [Edustor Android app](https://gitlab.com/wutiarn/edustor-android), select subject, select existed/create new class,
  type topic (optional) and link pages with qr-code scanning.
* Scan used pages, put them to pdf and upload it to Edustor
* Now you can access these scans in mobile app on class details screen

## Cool! I wanna try it!

Right now Edustor is on pre-alpha stage, so there is no public beta available. If you're familiar with Docker, MongoDB,
 Kotlin/JVM platform, Gradle and so on, you can try deploy it by yourself.
 
And by the way, don't forget that Edustor source code is available under Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0, which
 means that you can't use it for any commercial purposes.
 
## Any other options? 
 
 Of course! If you are interested in testing (or anything else), feel free to contact me at **me@wutiarn.ru** or 
 in [**Telegram**](https://telegram.me/wutiarn).
 
## How can I help?

If you want to contribute, please contact me. Due to the fact that I'm currently working on this alone, there is no 
comprehensive documentation, as well as issues and development plans.

## Are there any documentation?

Kind of. **API documentation** can be found [**here**](https://gitlab.com/wutiarn/edustor/wikis/api/index)
